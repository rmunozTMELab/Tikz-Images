# Tikz-Images

This repository contains a collection of LaTeX/TikZ source files and generated PDF figures for various scientific and engineering visualizations used in my projects.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into topic-based folders, each containing:
- `.tex` files: LaTeX source code for TikZ figures
- `.pdf` files: Compiled figures ready for use in publications or presentations

<!-- ### Folders

- **Embedding PGNNIV/**
  - `embedding_models_pgnniv.tex`: TikZ source for embedding models
  - `embedding_models_pgnniv_fig.pdf`: Compiled figure
- **Fourier decomposition/**
  - `fourier_decomposition.tex`: TikZ source for Fourier decomposition
  - `fourier_decomposition_fig.pdf`: Compiled figure
- **Physically Guided NNs with Internal Variables/**
  - `pgnniv_baseline_model.tex`: TikZ source for the baseline model -->

## Usage

1. **View Figures:**
   - Open the PDF files in each folder to view the generated figures.
2. **Edit or Recompile Figures:**
   - Edit the `.tex` files as needed.
   - Compile using a LaTeX editor (e.g., Overleaf, TeXShop) or via command line:
   - The output will be a PDF figure in the same folder.

## Requirements

- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
- [TikZ](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf)

## Contributing

You are welcome to download and use the figures in this repository, provided you give appropriate credit (mentioning me as the author, as I do for others' work where relevant).

**Please do not modify or overwrite the existing files.**

If you wish to contribute, you may add new figures or folders, but existing content should remain unchanged.
